The purpose of this app is to have users make a playlist. The features of the website playlist will show items from sources regarding a topic, such as a movie category and inside will have various movie clips that the user has. A person can create a user and leave reviews/comments on other users' playlist, create and edit their own playlist, delete their own playlist and users without an account can only view other existing playlists and cannot leave reviews. The website will also carry a search function to look up playlists.
